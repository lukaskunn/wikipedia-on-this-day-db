# Wikipedia On-This-Day DataBase

Wikipedia On-This-Day DataBase is a small API database of important events that happened on this same day in another years. This database contain events, births and deaths of important peoples.

This API / database was created with another API from [Wikipedia, On this Day](https://byabbe.se/on-this-day/#). I use those API for create my own API because that way i can always stay that online and make it easy to me for request the data.

One time the data base was create it will be stay forever online to make API REST requests
